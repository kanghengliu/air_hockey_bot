Robo Rink: Reinforcement Learning Implementation on Custom Air Hockey Game

Base game and training model can be found in the air_hockey_game folder - playable with instructions in the folder's README.md file.

pong_v2 is a proof of concept. It is a mesh of pong and air hockey that we trained a dqn model on.

The models folder contains various models that were trained on the air hockey game, with different model architectures, opponents, reward systems, and other hyperparameters.

The speed multiplier folder contains alternate versions of the training process with changes to increase the training speed.

The browser folder was a failed attempt to create a web-based version of the game. It is currently not functional.

Our presentation is in the presentation folder and report in the report folder.
